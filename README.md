# CSCI-166-Project
# This represent the project code I was working on 
# This is the modified version to tune variables on Ms.Pacman, record, and then combine the videos
# This is the link to the base code that I used: https://github.com/everestso/summer25/blob/main/c166f25_02b_dqn_pong.ipynb
# This is the google drive link to the mp4 videos for the project: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xsgzz_RwiFyS2NNXdmoZYx8wFlSHetPQ?usp=drive_link
# Each folder tells what varialbe I changed and the video of the agent adapting to those changes
# They each show the normal DQN version and the Double DQN one
